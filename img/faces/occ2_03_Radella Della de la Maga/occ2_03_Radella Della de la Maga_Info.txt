Creator: Amysaurus

Character Name
Radella "Della" de la Maga

Background:
Radella was the court magician of Mal’Duur, the Kingdom of Dark Elves. Annoyed by the prince, Jezerath’s, continuous advances, she quickly found herself exiled after turning him into a stag beetle.

Now left to wander between lands, Radella spends her time wreaking havoc with her spells, peddling potions to passersby, and scowling at woodland creatures in order to maintain her youthful glow.

Skills (if any):
-> Evil Eye: Radella gives her opponent a wicked stink eye, draining their energy (and making them self-conscious).
-> Bottoms Up: Radella grabs a potion from her stash and chugs. Results may vary.

Credits:
-> Kadokawa
-> Amy “Amysaurus” Hohman
-> … Also NPC, ThatMaestroGuy, and Nirwanda for nagging at me. Always nagging at me. Big sad.
