2. About Character

Background
Raze was found by a slave in the largest mining cave ever on the planet. He just remembers that his memory was purposely erased and that he had been sent to earth to find something to take to his world. He claims to be an inhabitant of a place called Rakuen Zero, which he says is the "original paradise."

Characteristic
It has no mouth or nose. The body has a round shape like a ball.
Its skin looks like soft leather covered with very thin fur.
Also, has two wings but cannot fly very high.
It has large eyes and a halo above its head that make him look cute and harmless.

Personality
He is cute, curious and loves to learn.

3. Skills
Mysteriously, it has incredible learning ability, almost as if it were remembering rather than learning. The halo above your head is used as an instrument of attack and defense.
