About Máximo
Máximo is a young boy who dreams of becoming a superhero when he grows up. Considering that he has a a special ability that let's him see the world as if it was a video game with hints, it's likely that his dream will become reality. But he's not going to just wait for it to happen, he's going to be ready! Trained by his father, the locally famous wrestler El Toro, Máximo is tough for a kid. But there's only so much one can learn from a non-superhero. Even a superhero needs practice, so Maxi-Man was born!

Maxi-Man patrols his neighborhood every day after school to make sure that everyone is happy. If there's trouble, then he's the first one to jump in to help... Though the 'trouble' is rarely worse than a misplaced wallet. That doesn't stop him from doing his best each and every time!

Máximo is the result of hitting 'randomize' in the generator a bunch, until he appeared and inspired his own small game.
