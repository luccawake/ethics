Character Name
Donica Linnell

Character Info
A natural born user of white magic, with years of education and experience in curative, protective and exorcist magic. Donica is a roller coaster of emotions; going from giggly and smiles one moment--to anger and discord the next... almost usually stemming from her easily irritable and standoffish attitude toward others.

With a regal vocabulary and a sweet sounding voice--you'd never imagine she'd be easy to anger, or easy to sadden; but hanging out with a varied crew of adventurers can have it's effects on someone's overall mood, good or bad.

Skills
Curative Magic: Ability to heal the wounds, soothe the ailments, or negate toxins on allies.
Protective Magic: Capable of creating shields of magical energy to reduce or outright negate physical or magical damage on allies.
Exorcism Magic: Powerful magic with the purpose of exorcising any undead enemy with the power of sunlight.
Recover: A prayer that can return a portion of magical energy.
